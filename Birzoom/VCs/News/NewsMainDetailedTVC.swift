            Weâ€™re all stuck at home right now. If youâ€™re like me, youâ€™re probably using this time to spring clean, organize your bookmarks bar, write letters to friends and family, and maybe even learn something new.

            As someone whoâ€™s fairly new to the field of UX design, I reached out to other Designlab team members, mentors, students, and community members, for advice on which UX design resources to look to for learning.
